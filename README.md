<h1>DenoSite</h1>
<p>Examples of HTTP Server and Middleware functionality in Oak for use in Deno</p>

## About
This is more of a example repository for Oak, not meant for building a Website or API. These are just building blocks to get you started with Web Development in Deno. Although Deno is new to developers. I find Oak as one of the best ones so far to use.

I plan to add more examples if I am expereinced enough with Oak. As of now. What you can see here is what I know about it already.
